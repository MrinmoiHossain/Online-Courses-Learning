# Example file for working with timedelta objects
#

from datetime import date
from datetime import time
from datetime import datetime


# construct a basic timedelta and print it


# print today's date


# print today's date one year from now


# create a timedelta that uses more than one argument


# calculate the date 1 week ago, formatted as a string


### How many days until April Fools' Day?


# use date comparison to see if April Fool's has already gone for this year
# if it has, use the replace() function to get the date for next year


# Now calculate the amount of time until April Fool's Day
